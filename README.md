### Welcome to my portfolio! 

This repository showcases a selection of my projects using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this initial iteration is to present my work in an aesthetically pleasing and easily navigable format. As I continue to develop my skills, I plan to create more advanced versions of my portfolio using modern frameworks and libraries.

This portfolio is a testament to my dedication to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code while focusing on user experience and visual appeal. It serves as a foundation for future growth and exploration in the world of web development.
